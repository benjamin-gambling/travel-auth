Implementation of User Auth/Sign Up

Sign in screen

Copy and paste all of the file attached called sign-in.html

This Is a div separate to the other divs (nav, itin, trip etc) I added it before the nav bar but it can be placed anywhere within the body. 

To match my styling you'll need to add all of the styles found in ‘style.css’ and add the following link (taken from firebase UI) to the header. 


<link
      type="text/css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/ui/4.6.1/firebase-ui-auth.css"
    />

Script 

	Add the following Scripts to initialize and implement firebase 

<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.0.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.0.1/firebase-auth.js"></script>
    <script src=“https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.0.1/firebase-functions.js"></script>

Below this add another Script tag (THIS MUST BE AFTER THE THREE ABOVE)

<script>
“Copy and paste the contents on the attached file newscript.js"
</script>





Experience Buttons (optional)

To do what I did with the buttons I had to slightly change them around. To do this the buttons change the code to : -

<div class="itin-exp-btns">
                <div class="itin-exp-btns-addlist">
                  <div class="itin-exp-btns_txt">
                    <i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                    ADD TO LIST
                  </div>
                </div>
                <a href="#" class="itin-exp-btns_share w-button"
                  >SHARE WITH SOMEONE</a
                >
              </div>

Aswell add the following link to the head (this is what I use to fill the heart) : - 

<link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"
    />


4. Sign in button (optional) 

To add the sign in button like I did just add this div to the nav section (after the next button). 

<div id="signin" class="nav-link w-nav-link"></div>
